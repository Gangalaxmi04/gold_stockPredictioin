#Gold Stock Price Analysis and Prediction
Overview
This repository contains code and analysis for predicting gold stock prices based on historical data. The project includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training using linear regression, and generating buy/sell signals based on moving averages. The goal is to build a robust model that can accurately predict gold stock prices and provide actionable trading insights.

Dataset
The dataset contains the following columns:

Date: The date of the stock price record.
Close: The closing price of the gold stock per share.
Volume: The total number of shares bought and sold on the given date.
Open: The price of the first trade of the gold stock per share when the market opened.
High: The highest price that the gold stock reached on the particular date.
Low: The lowest price that the gold stock reached on the particular date.
Preprocessing
The date column is converted to datetime format, and new columns are added to extract the day of the week, month, and year from the date. This helps in performing more detailed time series analysis.
Feature Scaling
Standardization is applied to the features using StandardScaler from sklearn.
Model Training
A linear regression model is used to predict the gold stock prices. The model's performance is evaluated using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (R2) metric.
Insights
The model shows good accuracy for both training and testing data, indicating that the model is well-generalized.
Metrics
Mean Squared Error (MSE) for training data: 32.58177485819339
R-squared (R2) for training data: 0.9996286432698391
Mean Squared Error (MSE) for testing data: 33.10359235189278
R-squared (R2) for testing data: 0.9996521447203367
Moving Averages and Buy/Sell Signals
Moving averages are used to generate buy/sell signals based on the crossover strategy.
# Defining moving average window lengths
short_window = 20
long_window = 50

# Calculating moving averages
df['Short_MA'] = df['Close'].rolling(window=short_window, min_periods=1).mean()
df['Long_MA'] = df['Close'].rolling(window=long_window, min_periods=1).mean()

# Generate buy/sell signals
df['Signal'] = 0
df.loc[df['Short_MA'] > df['Long_MA'], 'Signal'] = 1  # Buy signal
df.loc[df['Short_MA'] < df['Long_MA'], 'Signal'] = -1  # Sell signal

# Determine whether to buy or sell
df['Action'] = 'Hold'
df.loc[df['Signal'] == 1, 'Action'] = 'Buy'
df.loc[df['Signal'] == -1, 'Action'] = 'Sell'

# Display the DataFrame with buy/sell signals
print(df[['Close', 'Short_MA', 'Long_MA', 'Signal', 'Action']])

Buy/Sell Thresholds
Define thresholds for buy and sell signals based on predicted values.
